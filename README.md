# Data science DSC (Week 2)

## Introduction to the Pandas module

pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive.
It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real-world data analysis in Python. Additionally, 
it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis/manipulation tool available in any language. 
It is already well on its way toward this goal.
